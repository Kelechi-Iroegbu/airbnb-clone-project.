These properties serve as a visual language for developers and designers, ensuring that all UI elements follow a cohesive style.

Key benefits include:

Consistency: Prevents design drift and ensures uniform visuals across pages.

Efficiency: Simplifies development by providing a reusable reference for styling.

Accessibility: Ensures readability and sufficient color contrast.

Collaboration: Enables smoother communication between designers and developers.

Brand Identity: Reinforces the overall look and feel that aligns with the brand’s message.

Accessibility: Inclusive design ensures everyone, regardless of ability, can use the platform.

Positive Brand Perception: A polished, well-structured interface builds credibility and user loyalty.
